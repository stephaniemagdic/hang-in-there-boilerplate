# [Hang In There](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/hang-in-there.html)
## Week 2 (Mod1) at Turing School of Software and Design

## Project Description:
[Project Spec](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/hang-in-there.html)

  **Description**
  In this project, we designed an app that creates motivational posters! Posters can be created randomly, or designed by the user with the user's own images, titles, and quotes. The posters created can be saved and viewed later in a gallery of saved posters.

  + Access the app [here!](https://stephaniemagdic.github.io/hang-in-there-boilerplate/)

## Functionality
  + We can see a randomly generated poster upon page load as well as when the _Show Another Random Poster_ button is clicked.
  + We are taken to a form when the _Make Your Own Poster_ button is clicked.
  + The data entered into the form inputs will be used to create a new poster of the user's creation upon clicking the _Show My Poster_ button in the form.
  + Clicking the _Save This Poster_ button stores the poster for viewing in the saved posters section. This can be a customized poster _or_ a randomly generated poster! If you like it- you can save it!
  + Click on the _Show Saved Posters_ button to view all of the posters that have been saved.
  + Inside the saved poster gallery, posters can be removed by simply double clicking anywhere on the poster.

## Programming Languages Used
  + JavaScript
  + HTML5
  + CSS

## Learning Goals

  **This project should help you understand how to:**
  + Display clean and dry JavaScript to store our data.
  + Leverage the class constructor to create object instances using the ```new``` keyword.
  + Add, remove, and update elements on the DOM to manipulate the page after it has loaded.
  + Understand the connections between the programming languages used- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

  ## Planning

    **Planning**
    We approached this project in a collaborative way (driver-navigator), and worked through each iteration together to better understand the concepts needed to create our code base. It was important to us to craft clear and concise goals for each collaborative work period. These goals helped break the problems down into manageable chunks and helped to steer us away from time consuming rabbit-holes. We utilized our PR code reviews to keep our codebase _clean_ along the way, which helped towards the end of the project to limit the amount of refactoring needed.

    **WINS**
    + We learned how to access and manipulate DOM elements to create a dynamic user experience.
    + We further solidified our understanding and comfort of using the git workflow.
    + We practiced using helpful skills like pseudocoding, using the browser's inspector tools, and using console logs to troubleshoot bugs.

    **Challenges**
    + There was a significant amount of pre-teaching required to implement our goals which slowed our workflow towards the end of the project time.
    + Deciding on what the _best practice_ would be was sometimes difficult to determine based on our modest levels of understanding JavaScript.
